# KOLKATA_METROAPP
Journey Planner aka KOLKATA_METROAPP gives the user to look at the distance between two stations. This project coded using JAVA and uses Graph and Heap data structures. We need to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the stations.

We calculate the fare(weights) based on the distance between two stations. Many people travel daily by metro. This app just delves into the basic understanding
of weighted graphs. We treat each station as node,i.e a vertex, we create public classes and within in create sub classes . We define the distance
between two stations as edges(E) . all of this is stored in the Graph_Metro class , which is a separate file. The user is left with several options, whether it is to see the distance between 2 stations, or calculate the fare required to travel from one station to thenext. There are total 24 stations of KOlkata metro I covered. The user has to give input to the system and in turn receive the output, if the given input is valid. 
Another important concept/data structure covered in this code is HashMap that stores the key-value pair of each of the node. throughout the code we see the vertices and edges being assigned a key value pair. This is done so we can easily map the station name to it's respective  key no.
